- 👋 Hi, I’m @Wyrestraia
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing my understanding of the tools needed for web development with the goal of having marketable skills.
- 🌱 I’m am just getting started learning HTML and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on projects yet as I do not have the knowledge to contribute very much.
- 📫 I will wait to add a contact once I get a more firm grasp on HTML and CSS.
